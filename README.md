**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Mathilde Sreeves**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/codepath-memorygame?path=README.md%3A1%3A0)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [y] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [y] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [y] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [y] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [y] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [y] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [y] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [y] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [y] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [y] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [y] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [y] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [y] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [n] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [n] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [n] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!
- [y] 6 Game buttons option implemented as a harder level of the game

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I did not use any ouside ressources.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[While creating this submission a challenge I encountered was my lack of experience with all the languages used. Although I quickly realised that prior knowledge of these languages wasn't necessary I was constantly worried that I would not be able to complete the work. At first, I did not fully understand any of the code used. By taking my time to read the instructions and using my prior knowledge of various languages I was able to implement the requested code and add new features to the game to make it slightly more interesting. In particular, I ran into difficulties when trying to add new details to the HTML file. I think this was most complicated because the language isn’t quite like any other language I have previously used. By figuring out how each section of the file functioned, I was able to determine the syntax and key words I would need to add the new text sections and buttons. I appreciated being faced with three new languages to manipulate. Even if this posed a challenge for getting used to the syntax and finding how to implement the ideas I had, I was able to learn many new things in a short amount of time, and I very much look forward to play around with these languages on my own to see what I can create.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[Before completing this project, I was already curious about web development, how websites are created and how the internet functions, but now after having completed my submission, I have more questions. I have now seen a miniscule portion of what is possible in very little time, so I can only imagine the possibilities of what I could learn and create. What I’m most curious about is the foundation of web development. The languages we used were obviously implemented by others to facilitate web development in general, I would have questions pertaining to how these languages work on a deeper level. How you can change a display, create fonts, or how a button can link you to another side of the internet. Also, I’m very interested in how a webpage can be private or restricted access and how security can be built to protect information.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would use them to develop more features for the game. I would try to come up with other possibilities for levels. Some ideas I have would be to have a game mode where you have to input the sequence in reverse order, another idea would be to only hear the different sounds (without seeing color change), a third idea would be to have the sequence be indicated by words appearing on the screen. Each word would relate to one of the boxes, either the color of the correct box or maybe an adjective describing a picture in the box. Finally, I would play around with the webpage display to try to make it more interesting with the new game modes. I would possibly try to create a nice menu for the user to easily choose the mode they want.]
